**Arduino**
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.
**Potentiometer**
A potentiometer also referred to as pot may come in a wide variety of shapes and are used in many applications in your daily life, for example to control the audio volume of the radio, intensity of the light. A pot is a manually adjustable variable resistor with three terminals. The potentiometer is used as a voltage divider in the electronic circuit. The potentiometer is used in radio and television (TV) receiver for volume control, tone control and linearity control. The potentiometer is used in medical equipment. It is used in wood processing machine. Analog potentiometer is a three-terminal resistor in which the resistance is changed manually to control the flow of electric current.
light dependent resistors (LDR) are light sensitive devices most often used to indicate the presence or absence of light, or to measure the light intensity. ... LDRs have a sensitivity that varies with the wavelength of the light applied and are nonlinear devices.An LDR is a component that has a (variable) resistance that changes with the light intensity that falls upon it. This allows them to be used in light sensing circuits.
**Applications of LDR:**
The LDR is used in the infrared astronomy.
The LDR is used in light failure alarm circuits and used in light meter.
The LDR used in smoke detectors.
It is used for automatic contrast and brightness control in television receivers.
